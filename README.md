In the first task, you enter number of students, their name, id, number of books they have. You also enter the number of books available
in the library. You can access any student, then you can borrow books from or return books to the library. The number of books in the
library will be affected likewise. You can also independently add or remove books from the library.

In the android app, you enter Name, Surname(optional), Id, Branch, Age, Gender. On entering all fields correctly, the data will be stored
and will be displayed on the next page.

I have also added two other android apps/projects that I had done before completing the tasks.
One is similar to the task(it is a login app), where you can store multiple records/accounts and can view an individual account or delete
the account.
The other is a simple cricket game, based on hand cricket game. The match begins with a toss and you enter any number you like while
batting and bowling.
